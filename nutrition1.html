<strong> PRE-GAME MEALS </strong><br>
<br>
The primary goal for providing athletes with a pre-game meal is to fuel the body
for competition. The best strategy is to choose lower-fat foods. Fats take longer
to digest, so high-fat meals can leave the athlete with a full, heavy stomach and
not enough energy to perform at his best. When planning a pre-game meal early
in the day try to avoid foods such as, fried meats, fried potatoes, bacon, and
sausage. Instead, choose foods that favor leaner protein and carbohydrates such
as bread, cereal, and toast. For afternoon/evening games choose grilled, baked,
or broiled meats, tomato instead of cream sauce, low-fat milk, and baked or
broiled, instead of fried, potatoes. Additional food options for pre-game meals
include:
<center>
    <strong> 
Turkey or ham subs, fruit salad, and frozen yogurt
Eggs, waffles, ham, fruit
 Pasta with red meat sauce, grilled chicken, salad and fruit
 Smoothie, cereal, fruit
8-ounce cuts of steak with carbohydrates on the side.
For beverages: sports
drinks, juices, and water.</strong>
<center>
<br><strong> POST-GAME MEALS</strong><br>
<br>
Before you sit down for a meal, you should begin by replenishing your fluids and
carbohydrates immediately following the game/lifting … sports drinks, pretzels,
sports bars (containing the proper nutritional ratio), or fruit. This is usually the
hungriest time for the players, some good choices include:
<center></center>
<strong> Steak kebabs, rice, 
    Salmon, green beans, and corn .
    Roast beef, mashed potatoes and salad.
     Hamburgers, grilled chicken sandwiches, baked potato and juice.
    </strong>
</center>
When it comes to weight loss or weight gain, you must do it in small increments.
In order to add Lean Muscle Mass and discard Fat Mass you must combine a
proper nutritional plan and strength training program. By adding or subtracting
the extra 500 to 1000 calories you are allowing your body to change its
composition.

<center>
    <br><strong>POST GAME/LIFT SNACK</strong><br>
    <br>
For optimal recovery after competition/practice or lifting, you need to consume a
protein-carbohydrate mix. The snack should contain 6 grams of protein and 35
grams of carbohydrates. Suggestions include peanut butter crackers, trail mix,
yogurt with cereal, a bagel with cream cheese or peanut butter, or a sports bar
containing the right proportion. <strong>This snack should be consumed within
    30 minutes after competition, practice or lifting for optimal
    benefit</strong>

                        <div class="header__text">
                               <br> Protein has been considered a key nutrient for sporting
                               success by athletes of all eras and in all sports. Ancient
                               Olympians were reported to eat unusually large amounts
                               of meat, but today’s players have access to a vast array of
                               protein and amino acid supplements to help them
                               increase their protein intakes.
                               Protein plays a key role in the adaptations that take
                               place in response to training. Amino acids from proteins
                               form building blocks for the manufacture of new tissue,
                               including muscle, and the repair of old or damaged
                               tissue. They are also the building blocks for hormones
                               and enzymes that regulate metabolism and other body
                               functions. Protein provides a small source of fuel for the
                               exercising muscle.
                               Some scientists have suggested that endurance and
                               resistance-training exercise will increase daily protein
                               needs up to a maximum of 1.2-1.6 g per kg body weight
                               (BW). This is 50-100% more than the recommended
                               intake of 0.8 g/kg BW for a sedentary person. The
                               evidence for this increase in protein needs, however, is
                               not clear and universal. Part of the confusion is caused
                               by problems involved in scientific techniques used to
                               measure protein requirements.

                                Hard training and match play place a heavy stress on the
                                body, but good food choices can reduce the risk of harm.
                                Adequate intakes of energy, protein, iron, copper,
                                manganese, magnesium, selenium, sodium, zinc, and
                                vitamins A, C, E, B6, and B12 are particularly important
                                to health and performance. These nutrients, as well as
                                others, are best obtained from a varied diet based largely
                                on nutrient-rich foods such as vegetables, fruits, beans,
                                legumes, grains, lean meats, fish, dairy products, and

                                    and sports foods  </h1>

                                    <strong>  Protein powders and supplements</strong><br>
Protein supplements, high protein bars and amino acid
preparations are among the biggest selling sports
nutrition products. Although an adequate intake of
protein is essential for muscle growth and repair, this can
easily be achieved from everyday foods and extra protein
is seldom required.
Protein-carbohydrate supplements may have a role
as part of a post-exercise recovery plan, but the whole
proteins that are found in foods generally have
advantages over individual amino acids.
<strong><br>Fat reduction and muscle building </strong><br>
A huge array of supplements is on sale with claims that
they can reduce body fat levels and build bigger and
stronger muscles – claims that appeal to athletes and
non-athletes alike. The reality is that many of the
products that are effective in doing this are either on the
banned list or are associated with serious health risks (or
both). Some herbal weight loss products have been
shown to contain prescription drugs that are not listed
on the label.

<strong><br>Rehydration after exercise </strong><br>
Recovery after exercise is part of the preparation for the
next exercise session, and replacement of sweat losses is
an essential part of this process. Both water and salts lost
in sweat must be replaced. Aim to drink about 1.2-1.5
litres of fluid for each kg of weight lost in training or
matches. Drinks should contain sodium (the main salt
lost in sweat) if no food is eaten at this time, but most
meals will contain adequate amounts of salt. Sports
drinks that contain electrolytes can be helpful, but many
foods can also supply the salt that is needed. A little extra
salt may be added to meals when sweat losses are high,
but salt tablets should be used with caution. 


<strong><br>Caffeine.</strong><br> A small amount of caffeine (2-3 mg/kg) can
help performance in prolonged exercise and may also be
helpful in exercise of shorter duration. Such moderate
doses can be found in everyday amounts of coffee, cola
drinks and some sports products (e.g. gels, some sports
drinks). For example, 100 mg of caffeine is supplied by a
small cup of brewed coffee or 750 ml of a cola drink.
Larger doses of caffeine do not seem to be more effective,
and may have negative outcomes such as over-arousal
and poor sleep patterns after an event.

<h1 class="header__title">Hydration </h1>

<strong><br>When players work hard,</strong><br>  they lose sweat – in a game on
a hot day, sweat losses may reach 3 litres. On a cold day,
though, some players will lose very little sweat. Every
player’s hydration needs are different and will vary with
the weather over the season. Just as general training and
competition strategies should be tailored for individual
athletes in accordance with their unique needs and
preferences, so should their drinking and eating choices
during exercise. Players, coaches, and trainers should
‚fine tune‘ these recommendations to identify their own
winning formula.
How much and when to drink?
Players should limit dehydration during training and
matches by drinking water or a sports drink. Obvious
opportunities to drink during a match include warm-up
and at half time. During training, the coach or manager
should organise drink breaks according to the weather
and intensity of the session.
Training allows opportunities for players to get a
feel for sweat rates and fluid needs so that drink practices
can be adjusted accordingly (see box). It is not necessary
to drink enough to match sweat loss, but the amount of
dehydration should normally be limited to a loss of less
than about 2% of body weight (ie, 1.0 kg for 50 kg
person, 1.5 kg for a 75 kg person, and 2 kg for a 100 kg
person).
The negative effects of dehydration on highintensity performance are greater in warm environments,
so drinking practices in these conditions should be
upgraded to reduce the overall fluid deficit. This may
include drinking at the side-line when match play is
interrupted, or having extra drink breaks during training
sessions.
There should never be a need to drink more than
the sweat loss so that weight is gained during exercise.
This will not help performance and is likely to cause gut
discomfort.
When do you need more than water?
Depletion of fuel stores can be an issue for football
matches, especially for players in mobile positions or
with a running game style. High carbohydrate strategies
– fuelling up for the game and consuming extra
carbohydrate during the match – have been shown to
enhance performance in such players.

<h1 class="header__title">Training diet for soccer </h1>


A general healthy eating pattern helps to support the needs of fit, energetic and lean player. Nutrition plans should be based around lean proteins for muscle repair and recovery, carbohydrate appropriately timed for fuel. In addition, fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds and wholegrains provide important vitamins and minerals, along with some healthy fats such as avocado, nuts, olive oily and oily fish such as salmon.

Soccer players should adjust their food and fluid intake to match their training load. For example, during heavy training periods, a diet rich in carbohydrate foods is important to provide adequate fuel to reduce fatigue, sustain performance and promote recovery. During lighter training periods or rest days, a less carbohydrate is needed given the lower energy demands on the body.

Soccer is a professional career at an elite level, however many amateur players also have work and study commitments to manage around their soccer schedules. To manage this busy lifestyle good nutrition habits are important and make a huge difference on and off the field.




<strong>  Protein powders and supplements</strong><br>

<h1 class="header__title">What to eat before games and trainings </h1>

It’s important to start matches well-fuelled. Each player is different, but most will often eat a pre-game meal around 3 to 4 hours before the start of the match. This meal should contain some carbohydrate for fuel as well as some fluids for hydration. A small amount of protein in the pre-game meal is also useful, as it can help to prevent hunger during the game.

Some suitable pre-game meal ideas can include:

Wrap or sandwich with chicken and salad
Bowl of muesli with yoghurt and berries
Pasta with beef mince in tomato-based sauce
Pumpkin soup served with bread rolls
Chicken stir-fry with rice or quinoa
Many players will also have an additional small snack 1-2 hours prior to the game. This is often something light that is rich in carbohydrate but relatively low in fat and fibre so it is easy to digest.
<br>
Some suitable pre-game snack ideas include:<br>

<br>•Yoghurt with fruit salad<br>
<br>•Banana and a handful of almonds<br>
<br>•Peanut butter on rice cakes<br>
<br>•Toast with vegemite and cheese<br>
<br>
If solids don’t sit well before a game, or players are very nervous, a liquid source of protein and carbohydrate such as a fruit smoothie can be a good option.

What to eat and drink during games
Players should work closely with an Accredited Sports Dietitian to trial nutrition strategies during training and matches to find which foods work best for each player.

Hot environments, combined with high-intensity exercise can lead to high sweat losses. Opportunities to drink during matches are limited to the warm-up and half time break but informal breaks in play (e.g. injury time) can also be useful. Players should start the match well hydrated by drinking adequate fluids leading up to the match. Producing regular amounts of clear urine is a useful indicator of good hydration status before exercise.

Although the half-time break is brief, it is the only opportunity for consuming carbohydrate during play. Players with a high workload (e.g. midfielders) will benefit the most from consuming a carbohydrate snack during the break because these players tend to have the greatest requirements for carbohydrate and fluid during a game.

Chopped fruit or muesli bars are quick, easy-to-eat options. Alternatively, specialised sports nutrition products such as energy bars, gels and sports drinks can be quick to eat.

While water is the priority fluid during training and for hydration during the day, and in most matches. Sports or electrolyte drinks may be useful during a game for players identified as having high energy requirements or heavy fluid losses as they can deliver some fuel and electrolytes.

Post-match recovery
Recovery meals and snacks should contain carbohydrate (fuel), some protein (for muscle repair and development) and plenty of fluids and electrolytes to replace sweat losses.

A recovery meal or snack should be consumed soon after exercise period, remembering that recovery nutrition extends well beyond the initial hours post-game, particularly when the next training session or game is the next day.  Fluids (mainly water) should also be consumed, based on estimated losses.




<strong><br>Breakfast</strong><br>
